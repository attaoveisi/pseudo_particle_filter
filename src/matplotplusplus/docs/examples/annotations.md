# Annotations

[Text](annotations/text.md) | [Text with Arrow](annotations/text-with-arrow.md) | [Rectangle](annotations/rectangle.md) | [Filled Polygon](annotations/filled-polygon.md) | [Ellipse](annotations/ellipse.md) | [Textbox](annotations/textbox.md) | [Arrow](annotations/arrow.md) | [Line](annotations/line.md)
 
The annotations category is meant to create individual objects on the plot rather than representations of data sets. An important difference between the annotations category and other categories is that, by default, the annotations do not replace the plot that already exists in the `axes` object, even if the user does not call the `hold` function.
