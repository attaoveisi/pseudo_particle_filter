# Common Utilities

The headers `common.h` and `colors.h` include a number of utilities we use in our examples. These include naive functions to generate and manipulate vectors and strings; handle RGBA color arrays; convert points to and from polar coordinates; read files to strings; write strings to files; calculate gradients; read, write, and manipulate images; and generate vectors with random numbers. Although some of these functions might be helpful, most functions only operate on `vector<double>` and they are not intended to be a library of utilities. The sole purpose of these algorithms is to simplify the examples.
